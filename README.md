## Inspired by
[`React Selector`](https://react-select.com/home)

## Stack

1. TypeScript
2. Vite
3. React
4. Tailwind CSS
5. DaisyUI

## Demo

<!-- Check my application on [`gh-pages`](). -->

## Steps

1. Scaffolding React project with Vite and TypeScript
2. Install Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI
3. Create Select component
4. Finish single Select
5. Create multiple selector with "multiple" property. 
6. Deploy

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://127.0.0.1:5173/] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run deploy`

    > That will cause the `predeploy` and `deploy` scripts defined in `package.json` to run.
    >
    > Under the hood, the `predeploy` script will build a distributable version of the React app and store it in a folder named `build`. Then, the `deploy` script will push the contents of that folder to a new commit on the `gh-pages` branch of the GitHub repository, creating that branch if it doesn't already exist.
